Since the Weather Channel no longer provides free api keys, I used https://openweathermap.org/ instead.

An api key can be obtained by signing up on their site and either using the default key or creating a new one.
This api key should be added to routes/hw3.js in order for the url to be complete.

The city can be changed to any city in the world.

For testing purposes, the url can be changed to:
https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=M%C3%BCnchen,DE&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22
